I earned my BSc in Computer Engineering from Koç University and my MSc in Cognitive Science at Middle East Technical University. Currently doing my PhD at METU Cognitive Science Department under the supervision of Dr. Duygu Ataman.

## PhD Focus
My research focuses on artificial intelligence, deep learning, and natural language processing, with a particular emphasis on reasoning and compositional generalization. Drawing on formalisms from cognitive science and mathematics, I investigate how reasoning and inference can be modeled beyond benchmark success, toward explanatory adequacy. This involves developing theory-driven formalizations of reasoning that guide the design of reinforcement learning algorithms that provide feedback signals tailored to inference, as well as the creation of evaluation metrics that capture model performance and failure in a fine-grained, layered manner. By integrating formal theory, architectural innovation, and principled evaluation, my work aims to advance AI toward genuine inferential competence.

## Master's Thesis
For my master's thesis, conducted under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Aziz Zambak and Dr. Ceyhan Temürcü, I evaluated transformer-based language models on their ability to perform semantic parsing from natural language sentences into first-order logic expressions. To distinguish between lexical, syntactic, and semantic errors, I developed task-specific evaluation metrics to enable a more precise assessment of model performance. This task provides a rigorous test of compositional generalization in neural models and directly addresses a central debate in cognitive science: whether connectionist models can achieve compositionality and productivity without explicit symbol manipulation.

The thesis is available here: https://open.metu.edu.tr/handle/11511/109445

A pre-proceedings version of a forthcoming article based on this work can be found here: https://philpapers.org/rec/GRAPOT-20

My interests also encompass reasoning, logic, and argumentation theory, as well as the philosophy of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and mathematics.
