I earned my BSc in Computer Engineering from Koç University and my MSc in Cognitive Science from Middle East Technical University (METU). I am currently a PhD student in the Cognitive Science Department at METU, working under the supervision of Dr. Duygu Ataman.

## PhD Focus

My doctoral research centers on artificial intelligence, deep learning, and natural language processing, with a particular emphasis on reasoning and compositional generalization. Drawing on formal tools from cognitive science and mathematics, I investigate how reasoning and inference can be modeled beyond benchmark performance, toward explanatory adequacy.

Concretely, my work develops theory-driven formalizations of reasoning that inform the design of reinforcement learning methods providing feedback signals explicitly aligned with inferential structure. In parallel, I design principled evaluation methodologies that characterize model behavior and failure modes in a fine-grained, layered manner, rather than through aggregate benchmark scores. By integrating formal theory, architectural innovation, and evaluation design, my research aims to advance AI systems toward genuine inferential competence.

## Master’s Thesis

My master’s thesis, conducted under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Aziz Zambak and Dr. Ceyhan Temürcü, examined the ability of transformer-based language models to perform semantic parsing from natural language sentences into first-order logic expressions. To disentangle lexical, syntactic, and semantic sources of error, I developed task-specific evaluation metrics enabling a precise analysis of model performance.

This task constitutes a test of compositional generalization in neural models and engages a central debate in cognitive science: whether connectionist architectures can exhibit compositionality and productivity without explicit symbolic manipulation.

The thesis is available here:  
[Semantic Parsing with Transformer Models (METU Open Archive)](https://open.metu.edu.tr/handle/11511/109445)

A pre-proceedings version of a forthcoming article based on this work can be found here:  
[On the Possibility of Transformer-based Semantic Parsing](https://philpapers.org/rec/GRAPOT-20)

Beyond this work, my broader interests include reasoning, logic, and argumentation theory, as well as the philosophy of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and mathematics.
